Hi there! I'm a Machine Learning(ML) Engineer specializing in Computer Vision(CV) applications. Beside, developing software applications, I also work on building a friendly & welcoming community of like-minded individuals interested in ML/CV. If you would like to be part of the community too, or have business motivations, then feel free to get in touch.

## My Values

:open_hands:                Being welcoming towards beginners & enthusiasts.

:chart_with_upwards_trend:  Always helping others & myself to improve while learning new things.

:smiley_cat:                Having a beginner mindset & being a lifelong learner.

:v:                          Trust & professionalism

## What I Work On & How

Trust & professionalism is of utmost importance for me, without which I don't find any motivation to do anything further. Besides, I enjoy working on CV applications using ML tools. If certain specific tools doesn't exist then I build my own. I often work on 1-2 books at a time, so I wouldn't mind co-authoring one of your book.
