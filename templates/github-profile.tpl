### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Somraj, but you can call me Jarmos & I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer. When not writing code, I share my experiences & thoughts on my [personal blog](https://jarmos.vercel.app). Do check it out, leave a feedback over on Twitter or Email & you'll do me a massive favour.

That said, please feel free to check out my work & contributions on GitHub. Take a look at what I've been working & if there's anything you might want to contribute to.
